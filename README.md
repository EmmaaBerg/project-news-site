# News Site
My first project at Technigos bootcamp. It is a responsive news site created with the mobile first approach. For mobile the page is shown in one column, 2 for tablet and 4 if desktop mode is activated.

## The problem
My first time creating a responsive website so I started with a sketch of the three sreen modes. My main problem was figuring out how to layout my page. And I ended up using both flexbox and grid. I looked at Stack Overflow, googled a lot to learn both how flexbox and grid works. If I had more time I would like to add a hamburger menu in mobile mode.
